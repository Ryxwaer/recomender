## To Improve

- Connect the same books with different names:
  - The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, Part 2)
  - The Two Towers (Lord of the Rings, Part 2)
- Transform stored data - userId is irrelevant for the app as it is now
  - From the ratings CSV, we could keep just the average and count for every book
- Rerun data preparation when new data is added
